# React+D3 Tutorial

This project is a beginner level tutorial to setting up a react app. We will also look into developing a simple bar chart with D3.

## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js installed on your environement. Then we will use npm to get React and D3.

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now includes [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).

#### Node installation on OS X

    brew install node

#### Node installation on Linux

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash 
    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    sudo apt-get install build-essential

You should be able to run the following command after the installation.

    $ node -v
    v9.10.1

    $ npm -v
    5.6.0
